# UK Road Accident Data Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of the UK's road accident data, performed using **Excel**. The analysis focuses on cleaning, processing, and visualizing key insights to help stakeholders understand the patterns and hotspots of accidents across the UK.

## Introduction

The project aims to analyze road accident data from the UK to identify trends, patterns, and accident hotspots. The goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights that can improve road safety measures and reduce the occurrence of accidents. This analysis is performed entirely in **Excel**, including data cleaning, processing, and visualization.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is obtained from the official **UK Department for Transport**. It includes records of road accidents, including the location, type of accident, weather conditions, road conditions, and more.

## Analysis Overview

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed incomplete or inaccurate entries
   - Standardized the data for easier analysis
   - Handled missing or duplicate values

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Processed and categorized the accidents by severity, location, road conditions, and other relevant factors
   - Applied filtering and pivot tables for detailed analysis

## Key Metrics

This analysis provides insights into several important metrics:
1. **Accidents by Severity**:
   - Categorized into minor, serious, and fatal accidents.

2. **Accidents by Region**:
   - Breakdown of accident counts by different regions in the UK.

3. **Accidents by Road Condition**:
   - Analysis of how road conditions (wet, dry, icy, etc.) affect the frequency and severity of accidents.

4. **Accidents by Weather**:
   - Breakdown of accidents based on weather conditions like rain, fog, snow, and clear weather.

5. **Accidents by Day/Night**:
   - Comparison of accidents occurring during the day versus at night, helping to identify whether lighting plays a role in accident frequency.

6. **Accidents by Vehicle Type**:
   - Categorization of accidents based on the types of vehicles involved (cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, etc.).

7. **Accidents by Time**:
   - Analysis of the time of day (peak hours vs. off-peak hours) when accidents are most frequent.

## Visualizations

Using Excel, I created several charts and graphs to represent the accident data clearly:
- **Bar Charts**: To show the distribution of accidents by severity.
- **Line Graphs**: To track trends over time.
- **Pie Charts**: To display the proportion of accidents in different weather conditions.
- **Heatmaps**: Highlight accident-prone areas (hotspots).

These visualizations help stakeholders grasp the overall accident trends and identify areas needing attention.

## Accident Hotspots

A crucial part of the analysis is identifying **accident hotspots** across the UK. By plotting the geographic data, I highlighted the regions with the highest concentration of road accidents. These insights are vital for decision-makers to focus on high-risk areas and deploy targeted safety measures.

## Usage

The Excel file containing the cleaned data, analysis, and visualizations is available in this repository. To explore the analysis, download the file and open it in **Microsoft Excel** or any compatible spreadsheet software.
